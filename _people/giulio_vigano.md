Giulio Viganò is a researcher with a background in Applied Mathematics (M.Sc., University of Milan, recipient of the EG-Italy Best MSc Thesis Award). His work revolves around geometry processing and machine learning. He is especially interested in developing machine learning techniques for spectral geometry processing, and conversely, in using spectral geometry to advance machine learning. He has collaborated with researchers at École Polytechnique and UC Santa Barbara.
He is fascinated by the elegance of well-done things — from mathematics to carefully shaped ideas — and by the clarity that emerges from simplicity and structure.
