Hello there! I'm Lorenzo, almost at my second PhD year at the University of
Milano-Bicocca where I previously obtained my Master's degree in Computer
Science.

My research interest lies at the intersection between image synthesis and 3D
representation. I'm currently working with Prof. Simone Melzi at the 3DiG
research lab to explore novel flow-based representations for 3D shapes as well
as their applications in classical computer graphics and vision tasks.

If you are interested in what I do you can find more about me at [my personal
page](https://lorenzo.olearo.com/).
