I’m Alessandro, I have a Master's Degree in computer science and I am now a
second year PhD student at the University of Milano-Bicocca. My research
interests include geometry processing, computer vision and machine learning. I
work in the 3DiG research lab under the supervision of Prof. Simone Melzi.

Currently I’m working on the use of geometric priors to boost 3D data
architectures, with a focus on transformers, both in the context of point
clouds and meshes for tasks such as shape matching and mesh generation.

In my free time I enjoy photography and 3D art, passions that also drive my
research interests in computer vision and geometry processing. You can find out
more about me on [my personal page](https://ariva00.github.io/).
