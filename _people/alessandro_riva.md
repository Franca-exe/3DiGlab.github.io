Alessandro Riva is a second year PhD student at the University of
Milano-Bicocca and has a Master's Degree in computer science. His research
interests include geometry processing, computer vision and machine learning.
He works in the 3DiG research lab under the supervision of Prof. Simone Melzi.
Currently heâ€™s exploring the use of geometric priors to boost 3D data
architectures, with a focus on transformers, both in the context of point
clouds and meshes for tasks such as shape matching and mesh generation.
In his free time he enjoys photography and 3D art, passions that also drive his
research interests in computer vision and geometry processing.
